# Atari2600 Helpers 
### if following the "Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600" in Udemy

## Horizontal Positioning:
`python3 HorizontalPositioning.py`
### No requirements to run
Note: the remainder of the "division" in the script will never be bellow zero so we dont have to convert it
that also means that the fine positions we pass on the HMOVE ($2A) register will be between 1 and 15
